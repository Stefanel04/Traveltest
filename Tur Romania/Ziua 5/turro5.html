            <h2>Day 5</h2>
            <p> This time I had to leave early in the morning because a very bad weather code had been announced. I gathered my luggage and said goodbye to the beautiful accommodation where I spent the night. I was heading to Camping Cheile Turzii. It was going to be my first day camping in a tent. And on this day, I had to make several stops such as: Alba Iulia City, Teius, Aiud and Rimetea.After a few kilometers of walking, I crossed the bridge over the Mures River and said goodbye to the place where I had fished last night. Suddenly, I saw on the side of the road, a milestone of the Via Transylvania route, a sign that I was also on this route. Via Transilvanica is an endurance route that can be traveled both on foot and by bicycle and has a total length of 1420km, crossing 10 counties of the country. We advanced a little and entered the city of Alba Iulia. A beautiful city from all points of view: cleanliness, peace and education, what you don't see much in southern Romania.I revisited the city fortress which seemed to me as beautiful as last year when I came here, and even more beautiful. The clouds were starting to gather and I decided to leave. I went out of town and already a haze appeared behind me, thunder being heard in the distance. I was scared, I don't know if you remember, but I told you I was very afraid of lightning. I was pedaling on National Road 1 which passed right through the middle of a long field, so the chances of being struck were very high. Walking in fear, I finally managed to reach the town of Teius, where I stopped at a gas station in anticipation of the storm. It's been 10,15,20 minutes and nothing. I kept waiting and so an hour and 30 minutes passed and the storm had not come. The sky seemed to clear so we moved on. Basically, the bad weather bypassed the route I took today, that's a good thing, but I wasted time waiting in that gas station.Finally, we arrived in the city of Aiud.A city similar to Sebes, full of history. We stopped here for a while and took it to the most beautiful village I have ever seen. On my way to this village, I passed through the valisoara gorges, where there is also a beautiful castle. The road sparked many beautiful memories, because I had been here a year ago. We arrived in Rimetea, the village I was telling you about, being located at the foot of the Trascau Mountains, the view is sensational. The houses look like a fairy tale, and in combination with the landscape, they simply leave you speechless. I highly recommend you to come and visit this wonderful area! We advanced and reached over the bridge that passes over the river Aries, my favorite river, where we made a small stop watching the water come at speed downhill due to the rains on the slopes. Finally, from national road 75 we turned left and started a rather difficult climb. It was going to be the last climb and after we got to the campsite.I started climbing easily, I had enough time even though I lost time in Teius, and finally I got to the campsite. Turda Gorges could be seen sensationally from the campsite. I started setting up the tent with the door straight to the view. After I finished setting up the tent, I went for a short walk to look for the tavern where I had eaten last year. The food was as good as it was then! It was a busy day and with a lot of luck because we "fanned" the rain again!
