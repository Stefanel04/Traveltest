            <h2>Day 3</h2>
            <p>I woke up cheerful. Today I had to get to a place where I had never been before, a place of rare beauty, namely Transalpina.Am packed my luggage, caught it on my bike, ate my little jun and hit the road. Although today I was going to pedal only 60 km, I had to perform a pzitive elevation of 1860m, which is quite a lot even for an electric bike. The weather was gorgeous, neither hot nor cold, it was the perfect weather for cycling. Transalpina, also called King's Road, is the highest road in Romania, it crosses the Parang Mountains from the Southern Carpathians group and connects two counties: Gorj and Alba.Cu all this, not only Transalpina was to be climbed on this day, but also the Subcarpathians through which the road passed until I reached the entrance to the King's Road. Some climbs can be harder than those in the mountains, and will tell you a cyclist who has over 50,000km gathered from cycling tours.After leaving Horezu, we arrived in Polovragi, where we had to visit the Polovragi monastery, the polovragi cave but also the Oltet gorges. Unfortunately time was not on my side because I did not know how much I would do on the climb, because I will go quite slowly, between 10-15km / h so as not to make too much effort and I would not want to catch the night on Transalpina, because wild animals may appear. So we just visited Oltet Gorges.A cool place in summer and soothing. Here passes the Oltet River and besides, this Protected Area separates the Parang Mountains from the Capatani Mountains. I stayed a little to admire the beauty of the place, I filled the bottles with water from a nearby spring and we went on the road. We climbed a few more hills and finally reached the intersection with the road Transalpina.Nu we thought a lot and started the climb. On this road there were many foreign tourists on motorcycles but also with motorhomes. I climbed what I climbed and at one point I was hungry because of effort. I only had two chocolate bars with me. Above, we came across some stalls with souvenirs and food. I bought a piece of bellows cheese and a row of pretzels, filled the cans again (a lot of water is consumed on such roads) and stopped in a meadow where I ate. With fresh forces, I started climbing again, I didn't have much to go to Ranca resort where I had to stay. The weather on Transalpina is very changeable, now it is sunny and beautiful and in a few minutes a big storm may come, but I was lucky and the weather was still perfect. In the last 13km, I changed the battery that had run out with the spare battery that was 100% charged. After that I didn't think anymore and I switched the electric bike to Sport+ mode and climbed "whistling" as they say in our country, that is, with a lot of ease, with almost 0.Am effort I did this knowing that I still had a little bit to go, because if I still had good miles, I had to go also on a lower level of assistance, so you can save as much energy as possible. I arrived at the meteorology relay and took a short break before descending to Ranca resort. Arriving at the accommodation, I rested and then went out to eat. After lunch, I went to take some pictures of the Parang Mountains at sunset. And that's how we ended day 3.But that's not all, the real Transalpine is just beginning.
