            <h2>Day 4</h2>
            <p>Ranca, a small mountain paradise located in the heart of the Parang Mountains. I had a day full of adventures ahead of me, because I was going to leave for Alba Iulia, crossing the highest road in Romania, the famous Transalpina.Cu the prepared bicycle, I started on the road that promised landscapes detached as if from fairy tales. I gradually climbed the serpentines of Transalpina, enjoying the perfect weather and fresh mountain air. The landscape before my eyes unfolded like a moving painting, and the mountain colors accompanied me throughout the journey. We reached the top of Transalpina (Urdele Pass, 2100m altitude), where the view was impressive. Vast valleys stretched before me and mountains ploughed their distant ridges. A sense of freedom and fulfillment enveloped me in those moments, feeling small in front of the greatness of nature.Descending from the heights of Transalpine, I reached the Valley of the Lotru River, a corner of heaven where I had not set foot since I was just a child. Here, I took a break on the river bank, remembering the beautiful events of my childhood. After arriving in Obârșia Lotrului, I continued to pedal through various landscapes and I drowned to climb again, but I knew that after this climb, there would come a luunga descent to Sebes. We arrived at Oasa Lake, a beautiful lake located in the heart of Sureanu Mountains, where we stopped to admire the beauties of the landscapes. Walking 70 kilometers downhill, we arrived in Sebeş, a neat city full of history, where we made a short stop to discover its charm. We had a radical change in temperature. From 13 degrees Celsius at the top of Transalpine to 42 degrees Celsius in the city.Evening was approaching, and my journey did not end there. I continued my journey to Alba Iulia, where accommodation was waiting for me. A few hours before dark, I decided to try fishing on the Mures River.I headed to the river bank and took my rod with me for a fishing trip. Trapped in the quiet atmosphere of the evening, we waited patiently for the bite while Mount Parang watched over us from afar. From the peaks of the Parang Mountains to the foothills of the mighty Apuseni Mountains, my bike ride was a memorable experience. Each pedal brought into my life a story of wonderful landscapes and encounters with places full of history. And that's how day 4 ended
