            <h2>Day 7</h2>
            <p>In the morning he found me in Sighisoara, my heart full of joy and energy, knowing that I would only walk about 70 kilometers that day. Leaving the medieval town with a smile on my face, I started on Via Transilvanica, continuing my adventure on two wheels.
                The road opened the way parallel to the beautiful Via Transilvanica, and the landscapes unfolding in front of me were truly impressive. Whole fields of sunflowers greeted me with their vibrant colors, and the perfect weather heralded a wonderful day, albeit with imminent heat.Arriving in Agnita, a small town located in the middle of Romania, I felt like I was in the heart of Transylvania. We made a short stop to enjoy the most delicious donuts. With positive thoughts and refreshed energy, we started our descent towards our destination. In the distance, the silhouette of the Făgăraș Mountains began to show itself on the horizon. Also on this tour, I met these mountains again, on day 1. Crossing a reservoir on the course of the Olt River, I was enchanted by the beauty of Carta village.In the evening, we arrived at one of the most beautiful campsites in the country, Camping Old Willow, or as the Dutch call it, De Oude Wilg. Pitching my tent under the old willow branches, I decided to stay an extra day here at my penultimate stop. At sunset, I tried a spinning fishing trip on the bank of the Olt River, where nature and tranquility enveloped me in a fairytale landscape. The next day, we visited the only Cistercian monastery in Romania, the place where "The Nun" was filmed, a fascinating experience in a land full of history.
                In the afternoon, I headed to a pond called "Iancu's Pond" for a fishing session. With patience and lucky hand, we caught three fish, adding a note of satisfaction at the end of this wonderful journey through the heart of Transylvania.
