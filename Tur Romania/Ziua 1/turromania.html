            <h2>Day 1</h2>
            <p>I woke up early in the morning to go on a long-awaited adventure. I was going to experience cycling for the first time on an electric bike. I mounted my luggage on my bike and went to the first destination of day 1, namely Curtea de Arges city. Because of the bad weather codes, I was a little scared but in the end it turned out to be excellent weather for cycling (well, except for the wind) that started blowing after I had already covered 70km of the 150km I had to travel. Being the first experience on an electric bike, I did not know if the two batteries would reach my destination, so the first 40 kilometers of the race were done on my own, without starting the electric assistance. I had two batteries, but I still lived with a thought that the wind blowing from the front and the luggage on the bike would lead to a drastic decrease in battery range.The heat started to get more and more unbearable and I started taking as many hydration breaks as possible. We also arrived in Gaesti, a small and rather unkempt town, where we took a longer break. From here we had only 50-60km to reach our destination. The terrain was starting to get more inclined, and the bike helps me not to put so much effort, but beware, if you have an electric bike, that doesn't mean you don't get tired or put in the effort. We arrived in the town of Topoloveni, it has a bike path that crosses the entire city but unfortunately there are many people who park their cars on it. I was happy because I knew that from this place I would have a little more and reach my destination. We paused a little and hit the road again. Finally, we arrived in the biggest city of day 1, namely Pitesti. I didn't stay here at all, because I knew the place quite well and I had even been on a bike ride here. Unfortunately, after leaving town, I came across a creepy road.It was very, very crowded, narrow and had poor quality asphalt. The drivers were going at a very high speed and put me in real danger. Finally, I managed to get to Curtea de Arges.A beautiful city, arranged and quiet. I checked in and then went to bed to rest, of course, after a cold shower after a hot day. In the evening, I walked through the city and stopped at a terrace where I ate an excellent pizza. That's how day 1 of this tour went!
