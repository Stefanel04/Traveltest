            <h2>Day 6</h2>
            <p>In the morning, with each breath, I felt the fresh mountain air filling my lungs. But the surprise was the wind, which blew loudly and coldly, waving my tent like a sail in the wind. Although I was suddenly awakened, I immediately felt that this day was going to be special. I pitched the tent, battling the wind that never seemed to stop. After a little clutter and some clothes taken by the wind, I started on the road, on the descent, leaving behind the Apuseni Mountains and heading towards the Transylvanian plain and the Plateau TÃ¢rnavelor.Cu each km I pedaled, I realized that the wind was not only an opponent, but also an unexpected ally. He pushed me hard from behind, easing my effort and giving me a sense of freedom. Passing through Jidvei village, I felt the characteristic smell of vineyards, knowing that this is the area where the famous Jidvei wine is produced.The Transylvanian Plain welcomed me with open and charming landscapes. I chose a gravel road in hopes of avoiding busy routes and enjoying the peace of my trip. With each kilometer traveled, we discovered picturesque villages and welcoming people.
                Before arriving in Medias, I felt fatigue accumulate, and a hill to climb seemed to be the last challenge. Medias, a small town full of history, seemed to me like a clean and quiet retreat, similar to the other cities I had passed. National Road 14, which I ventured on, proved to be a wise choice. With a wide mooring, it gave me the security to pedal freely, enjoying the vast landscapes of Transylvania.
                However, my enthusiasm was tested when, just 5 km before Sighisoara, my bike's battery ran out. I was lazy to change the battery, so I decided to pull my bike up a hill, feeling every ounce of luggage pull me back.Once in Sighisoara, I completely forgot about my efforts, being absorbed in the beauty of the city. Sighisoara, a city full of history, teleported me to another era. We enjoyed a delicious meal at a terrace in the old center and stopped on the bank of the Tarnava Mare River.
                With small steps and the burden of effort, I came to the end of my journey. Every cycling and every moment spent in these places contributed to creating an unforgettable story.
