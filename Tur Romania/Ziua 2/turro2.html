            <h2>Day 2</h2>
            <p>On this day, I decided to pedal less. I had to relax a bit after the 150km I traveled yesterday through hot weather and a lot of headwind. We ate breakfast from jun and then we went to the next destination, namely: Horezu City. We didn't even get out of Curtea de Arges well and we started a real climb but having the electric bike, everything was much easier than on a normal one. When I ride my bike, to motivate myself, I tell myself these things: "I'm struggling now, but when I finish climbing, the landscapes are the merit of the effort." And so it happened! At the top of the hill, we had an excellent view. After any ascent, there must be a descent, right?  yes! The long-awaited descent! We walked a little more and entered the national road 7, a road of great importance by road, which connects the capital of Romania to the border in western Romania, Vama Nadlac. Being such an important road, I was afraid of the huge traffic. Fortunately, everything was superlative, traffic was almost non-existent.I was lucky! In a short time, we arrived in Ramnicu Valcea. Here we visited the city center a little, we took a break on the bank of the Olanesti River and then we went on the road. We didn't have much to walk, somewhere around 40km. Unfortunately, the bicycle infrastructure is pitiful in this city, as in many others in this country. I chose not to go directly on the national road that reaches the destination where I will stop today, but to go on another route, which is much more interesting due to the wonderful landscapes. I made a stop at Ocnele Mari Salt Mine but because of the large flow of tourists, I said I would not see it this time. I continued on my way up one hill and down another, and so on. Clouds began to gather in the sky and thunder could be heard in the distance. Ironically, they could be heard right from the direction I was going. I didn't have a problem getting wet in the rain because it was summer and hot, but my biggest fear when riding my bike is lightning.I was very lucky. The rain caught me 5 km before I reached my accommodation. I checked in, changed my wet clothes, and then a great flood began, with hail, wind and dangerous lightning. After the storm ended, we went for a walk in Horezu.A city that relies on pottery and the sale of ceramic products. I grabbed the rod and went fishing on a nearby river, but unfortunately I didn't catch any fish. In the evening, I went to lunch in the complex where I was staying. We had a delicious dinner and by the way, this accommodation was one of the most beautiful accommodations on this tour, if not the best! And that's how we ended day 2.
