            <h2>Day 8 - Final Day</h2>
            <p>The last day of the trip arrived, and I left the Old Willow Camping with nostalgia, heading to Rasnov, the city where I have a small holiday home. My departure was marked by emotions, as the road started on National Road 1, known for heavy traffic. However, I was glad to discover that on weekends, traffic was quite low, making it easier for me to pedal my bike.
                I made an inspired decision and changed direction, choosing one of the most picturesque county roads in Romania, heading towards Sâmbăta de Sus. Walking near the foot of the Făgăraș Mountains to Sinca Veche where I changed direction to Poiana Mărului. Here, I witnessed the power of nature, with the traces left by a flood - garbage brought by water, broken branches and bridges. I stopped to stop and marvel at the force of nature.Returning on the bike, we climbed the serpentines to the town of Zărnești, located right under the Piatra Craiului massif. Here, I felt like I only had a little bit to go home. With each pedal, I was greeted by the great view of the fortress of Rasnov, located on the hill. It wasn't long before I got home, where I was greeted by my parents and my impatient dogs. It was an unforgettable journey, sprinkled with stunning landscapes, natural challenges and moments of contemplation. I know that such adventures will remain alive in my memories, and the thought that more will follow makes me deeply happy.
